To make blinky you need:

riscv32-unknown-elf compiler in path
make
dfu-tools (for upload)

init.S        ->  9 rows assembly
main.c        -> 14 rows C code
linkscript.ld -> 36 rows linker script
makefile      -> 49 rows makefile

total: 108 lines

(All this could be made way less by sacrificing readability)
